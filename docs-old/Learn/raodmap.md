# Roadmap

#### 2022 Q2

- Build a single-chain aggregator that supports major DEXs on major blockchains, respectively.
- Develop Butterswap smart contracts that enable one-step aggregate swapping between major DEXs on major blockchains, respectively.
- Develop Butterswap back-end server, which constantly fetches major DEXsâ€™ liquidity information to support efficient route-finding.  

#### 2022 Q3

- Build Butterswap Core using a third party bridge to support cross-chain liquidity providing and swapping between popular EVM based chains
- Build Butter Aggregator that optimizes cross-chain route-finding between popular EVM based chains

#### 2022 Q4

- Launch Butter Bridge(a truly decentralized cross-chain bridge with maximum security) upon Map Protocol that connects to Ethereum and Near.
- Launch Butter Core to support cross-chain liquidity providing and swapping on Ethereum and Near through Butter Bridge; for other popular EVM-based chains like BSC, Polygon, Fantom, etc., use third party Bridge.
- Launch Butter Aggregator that finds the best trade route for cross-chain swapping between popular EVM-based chains and Near chains.
- Smart contracts Auditing

#### 2023 Q1

- Replace chains using a third-party bridge with Butter Bridge for maximum security.
- Extend Butter Aggregator to support Solana, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.
- Extend Butter Core using a third-party bridge to connect to Solana, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.

#### 2023 Q2

- Extend Butter Bridge to connect to Solana, Arbitrum, Optimisim, etc.
- Replace third-party bridge with Butter Bridge on all supported chains in Butter Core.
- At this time, Butterswap is a truly decentralized cross-chain exchange for the most popular blockchains and will continue connecting all popular chains that are new rise-up.
