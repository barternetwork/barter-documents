# Rewards

Users can earn rewards in Butterswap in the following two ways:

* Become a messenger
* Become a liquidity provider

## Become a Messenger

Messenger is an inter-chain program that is responsible for listening to relevant events as preset in the program and builds proof on the ledger of the source chain. A messenger needs to pre-pay the gas fee of MAP Relay Chain and the destination chain to earn rewards in the form of Butterswap's native token. In order to become a messenger, users need to stake a certain amount of Butterswap's native token.

## Become a Liquidity Provider

Users can add multi-chain liquidity pairs into Butterswap's liquidity pool to earn trading fees.
