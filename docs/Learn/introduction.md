# Overview

## Background

For a long time, the cross-chain exchange market has been dominated by centralized exchanges, which concerns people like us who want to build a truly decentralized crypto world. Of course, there are some solutions based on the MPC mechanism or ultra-light nodes, but none of them are perfectly safe. With the dream of building a cross-chain exchange that is not only absolutely safe but also cost-efficient and easy to use, we built Barterswap.

## Introduction

Barterswap is a truly decentralized cross-chain exchange built on [MAP Protocol](https://www.maplabs.io/). Our mission is to revolutionize the cross-chain status-quo and forge a genuinely decentralized cross-chain exchange with maximum security, minimum cost, and the smoothest cross-chain experience for the crypto community.

## Features

### All Chains Supported

As long as a blockchain is smart contract friendly, Barterswap will support it, EVM or non-EVM. This lets users swap assets from different chains frictionlessly.

### Maximum Security

Barterswap offers the highest level of security that no other cross-chain DEXs is able to offer.

### Lowest Fee Rate

Barterswap guarantees the lowest cost for cross-chain swap. By the lowest we mean the truly lowest, not relying on token incentives to compensate for the cost.

### One Step Swap

Barterswap wants to give users the best possible experience, users are able to complete complex cross-chain exchanges in just one step. 

### Trade Path Optimization

Barter Aggregator adopts the most advanced price tracing algorithm and calculates the best cross-chain route based on most DEXs.
