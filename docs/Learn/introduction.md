# Overview

## Background

For a long time, the cross-chain exchange market has been dominated by centralized exchanges, which concerns people like us who want to build a truly decentralized crypto world. Of course, there are some solutions based on the MPC mechanism or ultra-light nodes, but none of them are perfectly safe. With the dream of building a cross-chain exchange that is not only absolutely safe but also cost-efficient and easy to use, we built Barterswap.

## Introduction

Barterswap is a truly decentralized cross-chain exchange deployed on [MAP Protocol](https://www.maplabs.io/). Our mission is to revolutionize the cross-chain status-quo and forge a genuinely decentralized cross-chain exchange with maximum security, minimum fee, and the smoothest cross-chain experience for the crypto community.

The critical difference between Barterswap and other cross-chain exchanges is that Barterswap uses an innovative cross-chain model. __Users can add multi-chain liquidity and exchange between them directly using a genuinely decentralized way.__

## Features

### One-Step Exchange

Just one click to complete the whole cross-chain exchange process.

### Trade Path Optimization

Barterswap Aggregator adopts the most advanced price tracing algorithm and calculates the best cross-chain route based on most DEXs.

### Blockchain Infrastructure Security

Barterswap is built upon MAP Protocol, the only cross-chain infrastructure supporting all chains with top-tier cross-chain security technology.

### Cost-Efficiency Optimization

The superior efficiency of MAP Protocol leads to substantially low cross-chain costs. Barterswap has the lowest cost compared to other major cross-chain exchange projects based on the direct multi-coin cross-chain exchange mechanism.
