# Rewards
Users can earn rewards in Barterswap through the following two ways:
* Become a messenger
* Add liquidity to one of our cross-chain liquidity pool

## Run a Messenger
Messenger is an inter-chain program that is responsible for listening to relevant events as preset in the program and builds proof on the ledger of the source chain. A messenger needs to pre-pay the gas fee of MAP Relay Chain and the destination chain and get rewards in the form of Barterswap's native token. In order to become a messenger, users need to stake a certain amount of Barterswap's native token.

## Add Liquidity
Users can add multi-chain liquidity into Barterswap's liquidity pool to earn trading fees.
