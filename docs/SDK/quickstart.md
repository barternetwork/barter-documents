# Quick Start
ButterJS SDK aims to facilitate the development of cross-chain functionality by letting developers integrate asset cross-chain functionality into their application with minimal effort possible.

Any frontend/backend can integrate our TS/JS SDK to achieve cross-chain bridge/swap functionalities. You can choose to build your own UI/UX and leave the complex asset cross-chain work to our SDK.

## Installation
To interact with SDK, we recommend installing through the npm package
```shell
npm i --save-dev butterjs-sdk
```

## Source Code
source code is available on [github](https://github.com/butternetwork/butterjs-sdk)
