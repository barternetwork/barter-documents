# Fees
*this page is still under development*  

Barter Cross-chain Exchange Service and Omnichain Payment System only charges a **0.2%** fees of the total value transferred, this includes cross-chain fees and liquidity provider fees.

We are still working the exact fee model for Barter Chain Switcher. But our preliminary decision is to charge a **0.1%** fee on fungible token bridging, and for NFT bridging it depends on the size of NFT.
