## TL;DR
A peer-to-peer decentralized payment systems are the origin of blockchain technology, and one of the most common use cases. The idea is to eliminate third-party entities from the payment process and allow people around the world to participate in a trustless, distributed network. However, the overgrowing number of blockchains and cryptocurrencies has resulted in a major liquidity fragmentation. To solve this problem, cross-chain interoperability seems to be the solution. The problem is that cross-chain exchanges and bridges have a high threshold for users, first, the cross-chain process is very complicated, and second, users could put their assets at risk if not chosen carefully. And yet, why should Web3 users need to go through such a complicated process and careful research to enjoy cross-chain technology? We don't see every person using the internet understanding TCP/IP, and we don't see every person using social medias understanding the content-based recommendation algorithm, then why on earth Web3 users should ever be aware of the existence of cross-chain technology? Thus, with this goal in mind, we developed Butter Netork to let Web3 applications empower their users with a seamless cross-chain experience.
