# Butter Bridge

## About Butter Bridge
Butter Bridge is built on MAP Protocol, which is the foundation of all Butter's products. It allows the establishment of connections with all chains barrierless. In short, Butter Bridge allows users to move on-chain assets from one blockchain to another in a truly decentralized and trustless way.

## How Butter Bridge Works
Let's see how Butter Bridge works internally through Map Protocol. The diagram below shows Alice bridging 100 $XYZ from Ethereum to Near.

As we can see, the whole bridging process is done on-chain and inter-chain solely without any external validator or human being involved. To learn more, please visit [MAP Protocol Website](https://www.maplabs.io).
