# Butter Chain Switcher

## About Butter Chain Switcher
Butter Chain Switcher empowers dApps like multi-chain GameFi to switch users' onchain assets to another blockchain freely, which solve the scalability problem easily.  
By integrating Butter Chain Switcher into multi-chain GameFi, users no longer need to worry about the high gas cost when there are too many users online simultaneously. GameFi developers can constantly monitor each blockchain's gas cost, and bridge users' on-chain assets like tokens and NFTs to the one that has the lowest gas cost upon request. Think of it as switching servers in web2 games, they are pretty much the same thing.
