# Security
Security has always been the biggest critique in the whole cross-chain industry. Barter fully understands the importance of security and that is why we use **MAP Protocol** as our underlying cross-chain infrastructure.

## About MAP Protocol
MAP Protocol is simply the most secure and comprehensive cross-chain solution out there. MAP Protocol uses an independent network of self-verified light clients deployed on each blockchain for cross-chain verification, which guarantees blockchain-level security and ensures everything is controlled by codes. We believe the human being is not to be trusted, but code doesn't lie, that's why we are built on the best cross-chain solution that is truly trustless and decentralized.
