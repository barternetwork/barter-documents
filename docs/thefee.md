# Fees(Tentative)
*this page is still under development*  

## Our Cost
Our cost is comprised of each blockchainâ€™s **gas fee plus liquidity provider fees**. And our cross-chain liquidity pool is only open for Web3 applications to help their users exchange specific assets. Thus we could minimize liquidity provider fees down to 0.1% or lower. 

## Our Fees
#### Cross-chain fee
Cross-chain fee applies to Omnichain Payment and Omnichain Exchange. The preliminary plan is to set the fee rate to **0.1%**, subject to change based on market conditions.

#### Bridge Fee
Bridge fees applies to Chain Switcher. For token bridging, if the token has liquidity on major DEXs and CEXs, we charge a fee of **0.05%**. If the token is not listed on any major DEXs or CEXs, we charge a fixed fee in the form of the gas token or stablecoin. For the NFT bridge, we charge a fixed fee in the form of the gas token or stablecoin based on the market value of the NFT. We will adjust the fee rate based on market conditions.
