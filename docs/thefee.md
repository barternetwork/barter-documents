# Fees(Tentative)
*this page is still under development*  

Barter's Cross-chain Exchange Service and Omnichain Payment System only charges a **0.3%** fees of the total value transferred, this includes cross-chain fees and liquidity provider fees.

We are still working on the exact fee model for using Barter Bridge only, but one thing for sure is it will be surprisingly low.
