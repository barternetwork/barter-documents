# Fees(Tentative)
*this page is still under development*  

## Our Cost
Our cost consists of each blockchainâ€™s **gas fee plus liquidity provider fees**. And our cross-chain liquidity pool is only open for Web3 applications to help their users exchange specific assets. Thus we could minimize liquidity provider fees down to 0.1% or lower. 

## Our Fees
The preliminary plan is to set the fee rate to **0.1%**, subject to change based on market conditions.
